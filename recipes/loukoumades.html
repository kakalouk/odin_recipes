    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 460 g water</li>
        <li> 1 pinch granulated sugar</li>
        <li> 5 g yeast</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon(s) cinnamon</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoon(s) seed oil </li>
        <li> 1 pinch salt </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon(s) honey </li>
        <li> 500 g all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 400 ml seed oil, for the frying</li>
        <li> Handful of chopped walnuts</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds</li>
        <li> Extra honey and grounded cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> In a mixer's bowl add the water, the sugar, the yeast, and mix with a hand whisk to dissolve the yeast.</li>
        <li> Add the cinnamon, the seed oil, salt, the honey, and whisk.</li>
        <li> Add the flour and beat with the paddle attachment at high speed, for 3-4 minutes, until the ingredients are homogenized.</li>
        <li> Transfer the dough into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and allow about 1 hour for it to double in volume.</li>
        <li> Place a deep frying pan with 400ml seed oil over medium-high heat. Ideally, you need the oil to reach 170â„ƒ (340 F).<br>
             Put the remaining seed oil in a mug with a spoon.</li>
        <li> Take a little of the dough with your hands and squeeze it in your palm. The mixture that will come out between your thumb <br>
             and index finger, take it with a spoon. This way, you will help the dough slip into the oil. </li>
        <li> Fry in batches for 4-5 minutes, until they are nicely golden and cooked through. Remove and place on paper towels.</li>
        <li> Serve with honey, cinnamon, sesame and walnuts.</li>
    </ol>
