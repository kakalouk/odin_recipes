        <p>  I love a good green salad. Mixed greens, romaine, and kale are some of my favorite starting points for fresh,<br>
         healthy meals. But summer is a time when all vegetables are at their peak. Sweet, juicy tomatoes, snappy bell peppers,<br> 
         and crisp cucumbers abound. This Greek salad recipe showcases these veggies, without any greens to get in the way.<br>
         And the best past? Because the vegetables are in their prime, this Greek salad recipe is flavorful and refreshing with<br> 
         just a few ingredients. You only need 7 ingredients to make it! Itâ€™s been a hit at our family gatherings over the last<br> 
         few weeks-my mom even added it to her regular recipe rotation. I hope you love it as much as we do!  </p>

                 honey, salt, pepper and 1 tablespoon oregano. Gently stir with a spoon
