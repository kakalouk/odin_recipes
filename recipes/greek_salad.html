    <h1> Greek Salad </h1>

    <h3> As greeks call it, choriatiki !!!</h3>
    <p>  I love a good green salad. Mixed greens, romaine, and kale are some of my favorite starting points for fresh,<br>
         healthy meals. But summer is a time when all vegetables are at their peak. Sweet, juicy tomatoes, snappy bell peppers,<br> 
         and crisp cucumbers abound. This Greek salad recipe showcases these veggies, without any greens to get in the way.<br>
         And the best past? Because the vegetables are in their prime, this Greek salad recipe is flavorful and refreshing with<br> 
         just a few ingredients. You only need 7 ingredients to make it! Itâ€™s been a hit at our family gatherings over the last<br> 
         few weeks-my mom even added it to her regular recipe rotation. I hope you love it as much as we do!  </p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 6-8 tablespoon(s) olive oils</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoon(s) vinegar, of white wine</li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon(s) honey</li>
            <li> salt</li>
            <li> pepper</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoon(s) oregano, dry</li>
            <li> 350 g cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li> 1/3 onion, dry</li>
            <li> 1 green bell pepper</li>
            <li> 1/2 cucumber</li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon(s) capers</li>
            <li> 150 g feta cheese</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> In a bowl, add 4-5 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, the vinegar,
                 honey, salt, pepper and 1 tablespoon oregano.<br> Gently stir with a spoon 
                 just to combine, you don't want to emulsify the dressing.</li>
            <li> Chop the cherry tomatoes in half and add to the bowl.</li>
            <li> Thinly slice the cucumber into half-moon shapes and thinly slice the onion. Add to the bowl.</li>
            <li> Cut the green pepper into thin strips and add to the bowl.</li>
            <li> Add the olives, capers, feta and 1 tablespoon oregano.</li>
            <li> To finish, drizzle with 2-3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, top with rusks and serve.</li>
        </ol>
